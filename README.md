# Swim Lake Geneva
In the spirit of the tide display on the smartwatch I did recently, make a small
display of water temperature in Lake Geneva, and maybe some additional info.
I think I'll base myself on https://www.hydrodaten.admin.ch/de/2606.html

To spice things up a little, why not also take a Webcam pic: https://en.swisswebcams.ch/webcam/1450875805-Vengeron-%281292-Chamb√©sy%29_Weather

Still deciding whether I should do an Azure Function for the data (Ideally
I don't want to cheat and thus [write it in Swift as well](https://github.com/SalehAlbuga/azure-functions-swift) )
